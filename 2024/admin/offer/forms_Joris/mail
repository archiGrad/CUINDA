Dear Joris,


Thank you for your patience in working with us to plan for next year. 


We have attached your offer letter for the 2024-2025 Academic Year @ INDA which itemizes your proposed teaching responsibilities. 


Your university contract is being processed through the HR department of the Faculty of Architecture and will be shared with you ASAP, around May 23-24. In the meantime please review the Visaman Job Description attached which uses the same language as the university contract. 


This offer has been customized to you with careful consideration to your work assignments and corresponding salary.


Your course assignments fall in Year 2/Year 3 studio and Year 1 tools/technology. We are excited your offer includes a Lab Coordination role. We ask that in preparation for the coming academic year that you coordinate your entry into the coordination position by meeting and discussing the responsibilities with your Sequence Coordinator and Course Coordinators in who will engage with the lab throughout the semester. Your course assignments fall in the Tools/Technology Sequence.


As discussed in our previous correspondence, you are required to teach a minimum of two courses to qualify for a work permit and visa. Any course assignments beyond this minimum are considered your initiative and will be reflected in your salary. Additionally, taking on Administrative Roles and Project Coordination is highly encouraged in finding meaningful ways to contribute to our school.


If you would like to increase your assignments for the next academic year please consider invitations and open calls for expression of interest for available projects and positions this year.
